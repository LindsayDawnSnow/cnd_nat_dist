In total, there were approximately over 625 people stranded on area roads who had to be rescued and taken to warming centres. The majority of stranded drivers were trapped in their vehicles for up to six hours meaning that many people were forced to spend the night in their vehicles. The Canadian Armed Forces used two Griffin helicopters to assist the Ontario Provincial Police in rescuing 237 motorists stranded in their vehicles along Highway 402. One officer received a minor injury while trying to reach stranded motorists and one man was found dead from exposure to the elements.\n",

The earthquake had a depth of 24 kilometres and struck 129 kilometres outside the city of Sendai, 177 kilometres outside of Fukushima and some 372 kilometres northeast of Tokyo. Tsunami â€“ The earthquake triggered a massive tsunami with waves reaching as high as 40 metres and struck land as far as 10 kilometres inland. Close to 28,000 people were reported dead or missing as a result of the earthquake and tsunami. Japanese authorities estimated the number of people injured as a result of this disaster was over 4000.  Over 220,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.  Costs of damages resulting from the earthquake and tsunami have been estimated at over $300 billion. Nuclear Emergency â€“ The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was severely damaged by the initial earthquake and subsequent tsunami that followed. A nuclear emergency was declared by Japanese authorities following problems with one of the cooling systems. These problems resulted in three major explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant resulting in a level 7 nuclear meltdown. The explosions took place at reactor 1 on March 12, reactor 3 on March 14, and reactor 2 on March 15. On March 14, Japanese Prime Minister Kan announced that the 20 kilometre evacuation zone had been expanded to include a warning for people within 30 kilometres of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The Canadian federal department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) provided potassium Iodide (KI) to staff at the Canadian mission in Tokyo and Health Canada monitored gamma-radiation levels at the Embassy, confirming the absence of significant radiation meaning there was little threat to the health of Embassy staff. The Canadian governmentâ€™s support to the government of Japan included a disaster victim identification team, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear technical expertise and equipment, Canadian Armed Forces military assets to facilitate humanitarian relief efforts, relief stocks, and emergency medical and engineering capabilities. At the time of the earthquake, there were an estimated 11,000 Canadian citizens present in Japan. One Canadian citizen was confirmed to have been killed as a result of the earthquake and tsunami.

As of 2013, this event was responsible for the largest evacuation due to a natural disaster in Albertaâ€™s history. Beginning in northern Alberta, Fort McMurray declared a local state of emergency when water from the Hanging Stone River breached its banks on June 8. The storm then moved south on June 19, where it remained for three days over southern Alberta. Heavy rain spanning across a region from Canmore to Calgary produced an average of 75 to 150 mm during this three-day period. Twenty-nine local states of emergency were declared throughout the province. Four deaths were attributed to the floods, which caused significant disruptions across the province to power, telecommunications, clean water supply, and transportation corridors, including a section of the Trans-Canada Highway that closed due to a mudslide caused by the torrential rain. In Calgary the Bow and Elbow Rivers flooded, which forced 75,000 residents to evacuate the city. Over 4000 business were affected and 3000 buildings were flooded, including that Saddledome and the Calgary Zoo. The towns of High River and Canmore were also significantly impacted by the floods. In total, flooding forced the evacuations of approximately 100,000 Albertans. As flood conditions improved, some residents were allowed to gradually return to their communities beginning on June 23, while the remaining residents were allowed to return by June 28. Response to the flood was provided by municipal, provincial, and federal governments and non-governmental organizations. Insurance payments are estimated at $1.2 billion.

On May 3, the wildfire intensified and crossed over Highway 63, cutting off the route to evacuees, prompting the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation to declare a state of local emergency and a mandatory evacuation order for Fort McMurrayâ€™s Lower Townsite and downtown area, which included the communities of Gregoire, Beacon Hill, Abasand, Waterways, Draper, Saline Creek, Grayling Terrace, Thickwood, Wood Buffalo and Dickinsfield. Later in the day the entire city of Fort McMurray was under a mandatory evacuation order. During the evacuations two people were killed in a car crash. On May 4, the Alberta government declared a provincial state of emergency. The Fort McMurray fire quickly grew to 85,000 hectares as the wildfire spread further north and east eventually passing through Fort McMurray. Evacuees that fled north of Fort McMurray had to be air lifted to safety. Some evacuees were taken to Lac La Biche, while the majority where sent to Edmonton and Calgary. On May 10, two of the main Fort McMurray fires joined together and formed a massive blaze of 229,000 hectares. On May 16, all workers in work camps and oil sand operations north of Fort McMurray were forced to move south as the wildfire spread further north. Residents of Fort McMurray were allowed to return home on June 1. In total, the Fort McMurray fires burned approximately 579,767 hectares of land causing the evacuation of over 90,000 people and destroyed 2,400 homes and business, including 530 other buildings that were damaged. At its peak, there were over 2000 firefighters working the fires daily, including helicopters and water bombers. In addition, firefighters received help from 200 firefighters from the United States, 60 from Mexico and 298 from South Africa.

The waters rose as high as 4.5-6 m - some within a matter of hours. As a result of the flooding, roughly 13,000 individuals in the lower townsite were evacuated until May 2nd; this one was of the first major evacuations in the world to take place during the pandemic. Over 1,200 structures (mostly commercial) and vehicles were damaged which caused an estimated $549 million (CAD 2020) in insured losses. As a result of the flood, 1 individual was fatally injured and another taken to hospital when the waters quickly rose along the Athabasca River while they were ATVing near Fort McKay First Nation.\n",

Vermont was most affected by this stalled system as some regions received upwards of 175 mm (7 inches) of rain within 24 hours which caused the State's worst flood and natural disaster in its history. In Vermont, 1,285 bridges were destroyed in addition to significant property damage that amounted to $28.1 million (1929 USD) in damage and the loss of 84 lives. Although not as impacted at Vermont, the Eastern Townships were also affected. On November 3-4, Sherbrooke recorded 127.8 mm and Drummondville 148.3 mm of precipitation in a 36 hour period.

With this, there was widespread wind damage and other storm-related damage. In St. Catharines, for example, Lockview Public School experienced significant roof damage during school hours. The high winds also caused bridge closures including the Garden City Skyway after a tractor trailer blew over. Additionally, the storm caused flooding in Quebec; 100 residents were evacuated in Coaticook when the Coaticook River flooded its banks. This system also caused a few injuries and 2 fatalities.

On April 5th, an intense low pressure system moved into Ontario from the Northwest Territories and tracked over the northern Great Lakes. This system produced a tornado near Leamington on the 5th, created 110 km/hr winds throughout southern Ontario including 128 km/hr winds recorded in Trenton, and 25cm of snow in the eastern Lake Superior region. As a result of this second storm, there were widespread power outages, vehicle accidents including a 60 car pile-up on Highway 400 north of Toronto as well as extensive property damage. Effects were not only limited to land. A 2m seiche as well as 5 m waves were reported on Lake Erie which caused a lake freighter to list and its crew of 20 to be evacuated. Ice jams also cause the flow over Niagara Falls to be reduced by 95%. On the 8th, a third storm moved in from the U.S. Midwest. This system brought freezing rain (e.g. 13 mm reported in London) and heavy snow (e.g.43.9 cm of snow in Hamilton). Over the 5 day period, 13 weather-related deaths were reported.\n",

The winter storm covered 1,136 km2 and affected 208,000 individuals. Mount Pearl, Paradise and St. John's recorded, 93 cm, 91 cm and 76 cm of snow in 28 hours, respectively. A State of Emergency was declared in St. John's as well as 11 other communities and a request for assistance was made to the Government of Canada. Approximately 380 Canadian Armed Forces members assisted in the efforts where the majority of tasks required shovelling assistance. The storm is estimated to have cost $17 million (CAD 2020) in insured losses.

By the 6th, the wind was blowing at roughly 50-65 km/hr with gusts of up to 119 km/hr. Blowing snow caused severe road conditions. There were two serious highway accidents along Highway 400 alone which involved 60 cars near Bradford. The strong winds also overturned trucks. High waves and rafting ice caused severe marine conditions. A 2 meter seiche with rafting ice was reported along the eastern shoreline of Lake Erie which temporarily reduced the flow of Niagara Falls to only 0.5%. At least two freighters (The \"Labradoc\" and the \"Canadian Mariner\") required joint Canadian-US Coast Guard rescues. There was widespread damage across southern and central Ontario including glass panes being blown out of office buildings in downtown Toronto, damaged roofs, downed trees, and widespread power outages.
