A few days after the landslide occurred, a temporary 2-inch gas line was installed to restore partial service. The spectacular landslide flowed downstream, crossed the river and flowed upstream for hundreds of metres. This type of landslide took place in very sensitive glaciomarine muds, and is called a retrogressive earthflow. The estimated volume of material displaced by the landslide is up to 4.7 million cubic metres.

Earthquake – A magnitude 9.0-9.1 earthquake struck off the coast of Honshu, Japan on March 11 at 14:46 local time. The earthquake had a depth of 24 kilometres and struck 129 kilometres outside the city of Sendai, 177 kilometres outside of Fukushima and some 372 kilometres northeast of Tokyo. Tsunami – The earthquake triggered a massive tsunami with waves reaching as high as 40 metres and struck land as far as 10 kilometres inland. Close to 28,000 people were reported dead or missing as a result of the earthquake and tsunami. Japanese authorities estimated the number of people injured as a result of this disaster was over 4000.  Over 220,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.  Costs of damages resulting from the earthquake and tsunami have been estimated at over $300 billion. Nuclear Emergency – The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was severely damaged by the initial earthquake and subsequent tsunami that followed. A nuclear emergency was declared by Japanese authorities following problems with one of the cooling systems. These problems resulted in three major explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant resulting in a level 7 nuclear meltdown. The explosions took place at reactor 1 on March 12, reactor 3 on March 14, and reactor 2 on March 15. On March 14, Japanese Prime Minister Kan announced that the 20 kilometre evacuation zone had been expanded to include a warning for people within 30 kilometres of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The Canadian federal department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) provided potassium Iodide (KI) to staff at the Canadian mission in Tokyo and Health Canada monitored gamma-radiation levels at the Embassy, confirming the absence of significant radiation meaning there was little threat to the health of Embassy staff. The Canadian government’s support to the government of Japan included a disaster victim identification team, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear technical expertise and equipment, Canadian Armed Forces military assets to facilitate humanitarian relief efforts, relief stocks, and emergency medical and engineering capabilities. At the time of the earthquake, there were an estimated 11,000 Canadian citizens present in Japan. One Canadian citizen was confirmed to have been killed as a result of the earthquake and tsunami.

The earthquake resulted in over 8,669 fatalities, which include 17 hikers on Mount Everest who were killed by an avalanche triggered by the earthquake. On May 12, Nepal was hit again by two more earthquakes recorded as magnitude 7.3 and 6.3 quakes. In the aftermath of the earthquake, up to 600,000 homes were damaged leaving approximately 860,000 people in need of shelter.
